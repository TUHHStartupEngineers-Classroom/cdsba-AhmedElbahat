# Source Code

Use ``` to delimit blocks of source code:

```

```

Add a language to syntax highlight code blocks:

```{r}

probability_T_and_S <- probability_T * Probability_S_given_T
cat("P(T ∩ S):", probability_T_and_S,"\n")
probability_NS_given_T <- 0.8
probability_T_and_NS <-probability_T * probability_NS_given_T
cat("P(T ∩ NS):", probability_T_and_NS,"\n")
probability_NT <- 0.7
probability_S_given_NT <-0.6
probability_NT_and_S <- probability_NT * probability_S_given_NT
cat("P(NT ∩ S):", probability_NT_and_S,"\n")
probability_NS_given_NT <- 0.4
probability_NT_and_NS <- probability_NT * probability_NS_given_NT
cat("P(NT ∩ NS):", probability_NT_and_NS,"\n")
```
